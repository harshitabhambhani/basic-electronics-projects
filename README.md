# LED Blinking using Arduino

This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino board.

## Components
1. Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. LED (any color)
3. Resistor (220 ohms)
4. Breadboard and jumper wires

## Circuit Setup
1. Connect the positive (longer leg) of the LED to pin 13 on the Arduino through the resistor.
2. Connect the negative (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.

## Arduino Code
The Arduino code (`blink.ino`) is included in this repository. Upload it to your Arduino board to make the LED blink.
